  "question": "The bar chart below shows the expenditure of two countries in consumer goods in 2010.",
  "response": "The chart illustrates the amount of money spent on five consumer goods (cars, computers,\nbooks, perfume and cameras) in France and the UK in 2010. Units are measured in pounds\nsterling.\nOverall, the UK spent more money on consumer goods than France in the period given.\nBoth the British and the French spent most of their money on cars whereas the least amount\nof money was spent on perfume in the UK compared to cameras in France. Furthermore,\nthe most significant difference in expenditure between the two countries was on cameras.\nIn terms of cars, people in the UK spent about £450,000 on this as opposed to the French at\n£400,000. Similarly, the British expenditure was higher on books than the French (around\n£400,000 and £300,000 respectively). In the UK, expenditure on cameras (just over\n£350,000) was over double that of France, which was only £150,000.\nOn the other hand, the amount of money paid out on the remaining goods was higher in\nFrance. Above £350,000 was spent by the French on computers which was slightly more\nthan the British who spent exactly £350,000. Neither of the countries spent much on\nperfume which accounted for £200,000 of expenditure in France but under £150,000 in the\nUK.\n",
