## IELTS Task 2 Essay Feedback

Here's a detailed analysis of the essay response, following the IELTS band descriptors:

**1. Task Response:**

* **Band Score:** Band 7
* **Supporting Examples:** The response accurately summarizes the main features of both pie charts, clearly identifying the dominant income source (donated food) and the largest expenditure (program services).  It provides specific percentages for each category and compares revenue and expenditure totals.  All parts of the task are addressed.
* **Strengths:** The response clearly presents the main features and makes relevant comparisons.  The data is presented accurately.
* **Areas for Improvement:** While the response is accurate, it lacks insightful analysis.  Simply stating the percentages doesn't show a deep understanding of the data. To reach Band 8, the writer needs to interpret the data and draw some conclusions.  For example, they could discuss the implications of the charity's heavy reliance on donated food or the relatively low spending on fundraising.

**2. Coherence and Cohesion:**

* **Band Score:** Band 7
* **Supporting Examples:** The essay is logically organized.  The introduction presents an overview, followed by a detailed description of income and expenditure, and concluding with a comparison of the totals.  Cohesive devices like "similarly," "in detail," and "the other categories" are used appropriately. Paragraphing is adequate.
* **Strengths:** The information is logically presented with a clear progression of ideas. The use of cohesive devices enhances the flow.
* **Areas for Improvement:** The paragraphing could be improved. The information could be grouped more thematically to enhance readability and impact. To reach Band 8, the writer should consider using more sophisticated cohesive devices and structuring the body paragraphs more strategically.  For instance, a comparative approach to income and expenditure across paragraphs could be effective.

**3. Lexical Resource:**

* **Band Score:** Band 6
* **Supporting Examples:** The response uses adequate vocabulary for the task.  Words like "revenue," "expenditures," "donated food," and "program services" are used accurately. However, the vocabulary is not particularly sophisticated, and there's a lack of variety. Repeated use of phrases like "accounted for" and descriptive phrases like "very small sources of revenue" show less flexibility.
* **Strengths:** The writer uses accurate vocabulary relevant to the task.  
* **Areas for Improvement:**  To reach Band 7, the writer needs to expand their vocabulary range. They could use synonyms to avoid repetition.  More precise and sophisticated vocabulary would enhance the response's quality.  For instance, instead of "very small sources of revenue,"  they could use "negligible income streams".

**4. Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**

* **Band Score:** Band 7
* **Supporting Examples:** The response demonstrates a variety of sentence structures, including some complex sentences.  The grammar is mostly accurate, with only minor errors.  The majority of sentences are error-free.
* **Strengths:** There's a good control of grammar and punctuation.  The majority of sentences are grammatically correct.
* **Areas for Improvement:** While the grammar is largely accurate, a few more complex and varied sentence structures would improve the score.  A greater variety in sentence beginnings would show fluency and precision.  Minor errors are present which could be easily improved through editing and proofreading.  To reach Band 8, strive for error-free complex sentences.


**Overall Band Score:** Band 7

**Explanation:** The overall score is a Band 7 because the response fulfills the task requirements adequately.  It presents a clear and organized summary of the pie charts, uses correct vocabulary, and demonstrates good grammatical control. However, it lacks the insightful analysis and sophisticated vocabulary needed for a higher band score.


**Three Specific, Actionable Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Develop insightful analysis:** Go beyond simply describing the data.  Interpret the data's meaning; discuss the implications of the charity's reliance on donated food, its relatively low fundraising expenditure, and the overall financial health indicated by the near-equality of revenue and expenditure.
2. **Enhance vocabulary:** Use a thesaurus to find synonyms for frequently used words and incorporate more precise and academic vocabulary.  Aim for greater variation in sentence structures.
3. **Refine paragraphing and cohesion:**  Organize paragraphs thematically, grouping similar information together.  Explore using more advanced cohesive devices to transition seamlessly between ideas and achieve a smoother flow.


**Sample Improved Paragraph:**

**Original:**  "In detail, donated food provided most of the revenue for the charity, at 86%. Similarly, with regard to expenditures, one category, program services, accounted for nearly all of the outgoings, at 95.8%."

**Improved:** "The striking disparity between revenue and expenditure sources is immediately apparent. Donated food constituted the overwhelming majority of the charity's income (86.6%), highlighting a significant reliance on this precarious source of funding. Conversely, program services consumed the vast majority of expenditure (95.8%), indicating a focus on direct service delivery and minimal allocation to administrative or fundraising activities."


This improved paragraph uses more precise vocabulary (e.g., "overwhelming majority," "precarious source," "vast majority"), stronger sentence structures, and insightful analysis (e.g., highlighting the implications of the charity's reliance on donated food).
