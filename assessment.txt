Task Achievement: Band 7

The response covers all the main features of the chart and presents a clear overview of the main trends, which is that the UK spent more overall.  However, it doesn't explicitly state this in the introduction and could improve on highlighting the most significant differences.


Coherence and Cohesion: Band 7

The response is logically organised with a clear introduction, body paragraphs comparing expenditure on different goods, and a conclusion implied within the final paragraph.  There is a clear progression of ideas. While cohesive devices like "Furthermore," "Similarly," and "On the other hand" are used,  more sophisticated linking words could enhance the flow.


Lexical Resource: Band 7

The candidate uses a sufficient range of vocabulary, demonstrating some flexibility.  Terms like "expenditure," "respectively," and "accounted for" show a good range of vocabulary relevant to the task. However, there are some slightly inaccurate word choices which affects precision (for example, the repeated use of "spent" could be replaced with more variety. The repetitive use of "on" to introduce the goods could be replaced with more varied prepositions to avoid repetition.


Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Band 6

The response uses a mix of simple and complex sentence structures.  There are some grammatical errors,  but they don't significantly impede understanding. A few examples include minor issues with articles and prepositions. There are some instances of slightly awkward phrasing that can be improved.


Overall Band Score: 7


Brief Summary of Improvements:

The introduction could be more concise and explicitly state the main comparison. For instance,  instead of: "The chart illustrates the amount of money spent on five consumer goods (cars, computers, books, perfume and cameras) in France and the UK in 2010."  it could be:  "The bar chart compares expenditure on five consumer goods—cars, computers, books, perfume, and cameras—in France and the UK during 2010."

The concluding sentence could be made more explicit:  instead of ending by describing the expenditures on perfume, the response could summarise the key difference between expenditure in the two countries. For example, adding a sentence like: "In summary, while both countries spent the majority of their budgets on cars, UK expenditure significantly exceeded French expenditure across all product categories except for perfume and computers".

The repetitive use of "spent" could be varied. For example, "In terms of cars, people in the UK spent about £450,000" could be changed to "UK car expenditure totalled approximately £450,000,"  and  "the British expenditure was higher on books than the French" could be "British book expenditure surpassed that of France." The phrase "the amount of money paid out" is unnecessarily wordy and could be simplified to "expenditure."   Similarly, "Neither of the countries spent much on perfume" could be rephrased as "Both countries' perfume expenditure was low"


Finally, minor grammatical errors should be corrected during proofreading.
